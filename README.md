# DrexelCatalogParser
This uses java and the htmlparser Jsoup to recursively go through   
http://catalog.drexel.edu/coursedescriptions  

and pull out every class currently offered by drexel and stores it all in a sqlite database.   
It includes all information that drexel has including prereqs, requirements etc.  Please do not judge the uglyness of the code, i just needed something that works.  
I have included the final sqlite database output so you dont have to bother running the code.
